mod test_env {
    //! Thread-local overlay over the process environment, compiled only into
    //! test builds (#3191).
    //!
    //! [`super::Config::from_env`] reads ~200 environment variables, so the
    //! tests covering it must control those variables. Historically they did
    //! that with [`std::env::set_var`], which mutates state shared by the
    //! *entire process*. Under `cargo test` the whole suite runs in **one**
    //! process across many threads, so while a config test held the sentinel
    //! `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://127.0.0.1:1/testdb` (a deliberately dead
    //! port), every DB-backed test that happened to start during that window
    //! read the sentinel and failed with `Connection refused (os error 111)`.
    //! Restoring the saved value promptly narrowed the window but could never
    //! close it: the racing reader is on another thread, and no lock held by
    //! this module can cover a reader that does not take it.
    //!
    //! The overlay closes the window instead of narrowing it. Each test thread
    //! gets its own map; [`set_var`] and [`remove_var`] write only to that map,
    //! and [`var`] consults it before falling back to [`std::env::var`]. A
    //! config test therefore sees exactly the environment it asked for, while a
    //! DB-backed test on another thread keeps seeing the real `DATABASE_URL`.
    //! No mutation is ever visible off-thread, so there is no window to lose.
    //!
    //! Note this is why the fix is *not* a connect retry: port 1 is not
    //! transiently unavailable, it is permanently wrong for the lifetime of the
    //! process. Retrying would only make the failure slower.
    //!
    //! `cargo nextest` (used by CI) runs a process per test and was never
    //! affected; this bug bites `cargo test`, which is what developers run
    //! locally.
