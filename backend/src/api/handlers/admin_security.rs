//! Admin-only security analytics: CVE / artifact blast radius (#2364).
//!
//! Given a CVE id (or a single artifact), report **who is exposed**: the
//! users — or anonymous clients — that downloaded an affected artifact,
//! plus a bounded per-repository classification of how widely each affected
//! repository is reachable. Read-only; joins the existing CVE seam
//! (`scan_findings.cve_id` / `scan_findings.artifact_id`) to the per-user
//! download attribution shipped in #2365 (`download_statistics.user_id` /
//! `ip_address`).
//!
//! Phase 1 answers "who **downloaded** the vulnerable artifact". Phase 2
//! (#2386) adds the latent blast radius: the principals who *can read* an
//! affected artifact in a **restricted** repository but have **no download
//! record** (`.../accessible-users`). It inverts the shared REST read predicate
//! (`repository_service::permissions_grant_exists_for` + `role_assignments` +
//! admin) and anti-joins `download_statistics`, so the report over-approximates
//! (superset) rather than under-reports who could pull a vulnerable artifact.
//! Public / global repos are never enumerated (`exposure: everyone` /
//! `effectively-everyone`).
//!
//! Everything here is mounted under the `/admin` nest (admin_middleware),
//! and each handler re-checks `is_admin` as defense in depth: download
//! attribution is sensitive telemetry.
