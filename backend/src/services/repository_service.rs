/// What a [`RepositoryService::user_can_access_repo`] call is actually asking

///
/// Before this existed the function took no action at all, so it could only
/// answer *"does this principal hold ANY grant on this repository"* — and every
/// caller, including the ones serving artifact BYTES, got that answer. A
/// principal whose only entitlement was `{write}` (or a role carrying no
/// `read`, or a fine-grained rule with an unrecognised action string, since the
/// grant fragment tests only `actions <> '{}'`) therefore passed the gate on a
/// private repository's content reads, while the equivalent OCI `/v2` and
/// native-format reads correctly refused.
///
/// Making the action a REQUIRED parameter is the point. An added variant or a
/// new call site cannot silently inherit the action-blind behaviour: the author
/// has to name which question they mean, and [`TenantOnly`](Self::TenantOnly)
/// — the one that keeps the old semantics — is greppable and is required by
/// `every_user_can_access_repo_call_names_its_action` to carry a written
/// justification.
///
/// This is the #3326 shape (`try_authorize_virtual_members`) applied to the
/// REST content paths: the tenant gate is kept and the canonical ACTION
/// choke-point, [`PermissionService::check_repository_action`], is layered on
/// top of it — the SAME function, with the same arguments, that the direct

///
/// Global search (#3697) needs the same repository set the read gate admits,

/// as `WHERE EXISTS (...)` over `repositories` is correct but has two defects:
///
/// 1. It is the TENANT half only (`actions <> '{{}}'`). The read gate is
///    `permissions_grant_exists_for` AND [`PermissionService::check_repository_action`]
///    with `read`, and `write` does not imply `read` — so the bare fragment
///    admits a `{{write}}`-only publisher to a private repository's artifact
///    inventory. [`RepoAccess::TenantOnly`]'s own contract forbids fronting
///    "anything that returns a private repository's contents" (#3331).
/// 2. Correlated per-row, it seq-scans `repositories` and re-runs the
///    fragment's project subquery once per row: measured 0.5 ms -> 315 ms at
///    10k repositories for a caller in 50 groups, paid by every non-admin
///    search request regardless of how much access the caller has.
///
/// So this is a deliberate second predicate, and it must stay **semantically
/// equal to `permissions_grant_exists_for` AND the `read` arm of
/// `check_repository_action`**. Two things keep it honest:
///
/// * The principal disjunct and the target disjunct are transcribed from
///   [`permissions_grant_exists_for`] unchanged — same
///   `IN ('user', 'service_account')` arm, same `user_group_members` group
///   arm, same repository/project target pair, same absence of a
///   `target_type = 'system'` arm. Only the project arm's shape changes: the
///   fragment's correlated `(SELECT rp.project_id FROM repositories rp WHERE
///   rp.id = ...)` becomes the join's own `{repo_alias}.project_id`, which is
///   the same value by construction (`rp.id = {repo_alias}.id` means `rp` IS
///   that row) and is what makes the rewrite set-driven.
/// * `search_grant_arm_matches_the_shared_fragment_reference_db` asserts set
///   equality against a reference query built from the real
///   [`permissions_grant_exists_for`] plus the read term, over a seeded matrix
///   of every grant shape; and
///   `search_grant_arm_is_contained_by_the_read_gate_db` asserts every
///   repository this arm yields passes
///   [`RepositoryService::user_can_access_repo`] with [`RepoAccess::READ`].
///
/// # Containment, not equality
///
/// This arm is `<=` the read gate, which is what an additive `UNION` arm needs:

/// the role-assignment fallback branch, which the caller's separate
/// `role_assignments` UNION arm covers (and which remains action-blind; that is
/// pre-existing and out of scope here, see #3697).
